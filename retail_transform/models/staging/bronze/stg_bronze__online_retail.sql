================================================================================
STAGING MODEL: stg_bronze__online_retail
================================================================================

Purpose:
    Transform raw bronze data into clean, typed, and standardized format.
    This is the foundational staging model for all downstream transformations.

Transformations Applied:
    1. Type casting from TEXT to appropriate data types
    2. Column renaming to follow naming conventions (snake_case)
    3. Basic data cleaning (trim whitespace, handle nulls)
    4. Filter out obviously invalid records
    5. Add calculated fields for data quality flags

Materialization: VIEW (ensures fresh data on each query)
Grain: One row per invoice line item (same as source)
Dependencies: source('bronze', 'online_retail_raw')
